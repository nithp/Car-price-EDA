# Car-price-EDA
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project aimed at predicting car prices. The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, normalization, binning, correlation analysis, and data visualization. A linear regression model is developed to predict car prices, providing valuable insights into the key factors affecting vehicle pricing. Ideal for those interested in understanding data preprocessing and predictive modeling techniques in real-world datasets.

Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive EDA on a car price dataset. The main goal is to extract insights and identify patterns that affect vehicle pricing. The final output is a linear regression model that predicts car prices based on the features analyzed.

Dataset

Description: The dataset includes features such as vehicle make, model, year, mileage, engine size, and more. Missing values were handled, and relevant features were normalized and binned.

EDA Process
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values and outliers.
Normalized and binned numerical features.
Correlation Analysis:

Analyzed correlations between features to understand relationships and their impact on price.
Data Visualization:

Visualized data using heatmaps, scatter plots, and bar charts to uncover patterns and trends.
Modeling
Linear Regression: Built a linear regression model to predict car prices based on the cleaned and preprocessed data.
Results
The model achieved an R-squared value of 0.85, indicating a strong fit to the data and providing valuable insights into the factors that influence car pricing.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
